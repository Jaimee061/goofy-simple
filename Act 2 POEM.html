<br><center><h1> I Wandered Lonely As A Cloud</center></h1>
<center><br><p><i>W</i>illiam <i>W</i>ordsworth</P><br><br>
<p><em><b>I</b></em> wandered lonely as a cloud</p>
<p>That floats on high o'er vales and hills,</P>
<P>When all at once I saw a crowd,</P>
<p>A host, of golden daffodils;</P>
<p>Beside the lake, beneath the trees,</P>
<p>Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.</p>
<br><br><br>
<p>Continuous as the stars that shine</P>
<p>And twinkle on the Milky Way,</p>
<P>They stretched in never-ending line</p>
<p>Along the margin of a bay:</p>
<p>Ten thousand saw I at a glance,</p>
<p>Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.</p>
<br><br><br>
<p>The waves beside them danced; but they</p>
<P>Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:</p>
<P>A poet could not but be gay,</p>
<P>In such a jocund company:</p>
<P>I gazed—and gazed—but little thought</p>
<P>What wealth the show to me had brought:</p>
<br><br><br>
<p>For oft, when on my couch I lie</p>
<p>In vacant or in pensive mood,</p>
<p>They flash upon that inward eye</p>
<p>Which is the bliss of solitude;</p>
<p>And then my heart with pleasure fills,</p>
<p>And dances with the daffodils.</p>
