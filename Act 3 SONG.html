<p style="text-align: left; display:flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center">When do stars fade their light?<br>
Does the moon and the sun make it right for you?<br>
The world maybe, like an endless storm<br>
Chasing a mystery<br><br>
Is there hate in your heart?<br>
Does your body drop and tell you to stop<br>
Loving you, loving me?
When it all falls down, you just sing with me<br><br><br>
'Cause there's a blue sky waiting tomorrow, waiting tomorrow<br>
Shining and shimmering<br>
A blue sky waiting tomorrow, waiting tomorrow<br>
Maybe it's all we need<br><br>
Oh, don't you wash away that smile<br>
You just look out the window and see the light<br>
It's beautiful to be alive<br>
It's wonderful to live a life<br>
The sun is sure to shine<br>
For you and me, for everyone<br>
So don't be sad, it's just the start<br>
Of a new beginning in your life<br><br>
A blue sky waiting tomorrow, waiting tomorrow<br>
Shining and shimmering<br>
A blue sky waiting tomorrow, waiting tomorrow<br>
Maybe it's all we need<br><br>
Rain will keep on pouring<br>
Some things you can't control<br>
While the sun seems far and hard to hold<br>
It will unfold<br>
There will always be a blue sky<br>
A blue sky waiting tomorrow<br>
Full of hope, yeah, yeah<br>
Full of hope, yeah<br><br>
'Cause there's a blue sky waiting tomorrow, waiting tomorrow<br>
Shining and shimmering<br>
A blue sky waiting tomorrow, waiting tomorrow<br>
Maybe it's all we need<br>
