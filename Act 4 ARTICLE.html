<h3>MANILA, PHILIPPINES — The National Economic and Deployment Authoroty (NEDA) on Tuesday said an estimated <br>40,000 to 140,000 workers may be negatively affected by the recent P35 minimum wage hike in Metro Manila</p></h3>

<p><h3>According to Sec. Arsenio Balisacan, such an event may occur once smaller businesses — or micro,<br>
small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) — end up closing or reducing their personnel to abide by the new<br> minimum wage. However, he also clarified that such projected figures are “negligible,” especially relative to<br> the effects of higher rate adjustments. “It could increase the unemployment rate but again, it’s a very <br>negligible number; and it could impact something like 40,000 to 140,000, depending on the<br> region but still again, not as big as one would expect if those were much higher,” Balisacan said.</p></h3>
